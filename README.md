# game-of-life-book
A textbook for Conway's Game of Life. Compile from main.tex. To compile just a chapter or two at a time (recommended, since compilation of the full book takes so long), comment out any unnecessary chapters in main.tex prior to compilation. For example, to compile the book without Chapter 3: Oscillators, change the following line:

\include{oscillators}

in main.tex to:

%\include{oscillators}
